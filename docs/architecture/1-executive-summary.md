# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 Architecture Philosophy
This architecture implements a **progressive enhancement strategy** - starting with a web-based prototype that validates core concepts, then evolving to a production-grade mobile-native application. The design prioritizes:

- **User Experience First:** Zero-typing workflow with sub-30-second contact creation
- **Progressive Web App → Native Evolution:** Rapid prototyping to validated mobile experience
- **Offline-First Processing:** Local OCR with cloud enhancement for optimal performance
- **Microservices Backend:** Scalable, independent services for growth
- **Privacy by Design:** Local processing with opt-in cloud enrichment

## 1.2 Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| PWA → Native Migration | Faster validation, easier testing | Performance vs speed-to-market |
| Local OCR + Cloud Enhancement | Offline capability + accuracy | Complexity vs reliability |
| Microservices Backend | Independent scaling, maintainability | Initial complexity vs long-term flexibility |
| API-First Design | Platform flexibility, future integrations | Additional abstraction vs direct access |
