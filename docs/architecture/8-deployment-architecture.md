# 8. Deployment Architecture

## 8.1 Development Environment

```yaml
Local Development:
  Frontend: 
    - Vite dev server (localhost:3000)
    - Hot module replacement
    - Service worker disabled
  
  Backend:
    - Node.js with nodemon (localhost:3001)
    - PostgreSQL (Docker container)
    - Redis (Docker container)
    - Local file storage
  
  External Services:
    - Mock APIs for development
    - Test API keys with rate limits
```

## 8.2 Production Deployment

### Cloud Infrastructure (AWS Example)
```yaml
Frontend Deployment:
  - S3 bucket with CloudFront CDN
  - Custom domain with SSL certificate
  - Progressive Web App manifest
  - Service worker for offline capability

Backend Deployment:
  API Gateway: AWS Application Load Balancer
  Compute: ECS Fargate containers
  Database: RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
  Cache: ElastiCache Redis cluster
  File Storage: S3 with CloudFront
  
  External Integrations:
    - Google Vision API
    - LinkedIn API (OAuth)
    - Clearbit API
    - SendGrid for emails

Monitoring & Observability:
  - CloudWatch for logs and metrics
  - AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
  - DataDog for application monitoring
  - Sentry for error tracking
```

### Alternative: Serverless Deployment
```yaml
Platform: Vercel + Supabase

Frontend:
  - Vercel for static hosting
  - Edge functions for API routes
  - CDN and global distribution

Backend:
  - Vercel serverless functions
  - Supabase for PostgreSQL + Auth
  - Upstash Redis for caching
  - Cloudinary for image processing

Benefits:
  - Zero server management
  - Automatic scaling
  - Global edge deployment
  - Cost-effective for MVP
```
