# Tech Stack

This document outlines the technology stack used in the Visiting Card project, including rationale for each choice and alternatives considered.

## Core Framework

### React 18.2.0
**Why chosen:**
- Industry standard for component-based UIs
- Excellent ecosystem and community support  
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Concurrent features for better user experience
- Hooks provide clean state management patterns

**Alternatives considered:**
- Vue.js (less ecosystem maturity)
- Angular (too heavyweight for this use case)
- Svelte (smaller ecosystem, newer)

### TypeScript 4.9.0
**Why chosen:**
- Static typing reduces runtime errors
- Better IDE support and developer experience
- Excellent React integration
- Industry standard for large JavaScript applications
- Future-proofs the codebase

**Alternatives considered:**
- JavaScript (no static typing benefits)
- Flow (less ecosystem support)

## Build Tools

### Create React App (react-scripts 5.0.1)
**Why chosen:**
- Zero-config setup for React + TypeScript
- Includes webpack, Babel, ESLint out of the box
- Easy to eject if more control needed
- Well-maintained by React team

**Alternatives considered:**
- Vite (faster dev server, but CRA is more battle-tested)
- Custom webpack config (more complexity)
- Next.js (overkill for single-page app)

## Styling

### Tailwind CSS 3.2.0
**Why chosen:**
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Excellent design consistency
- Small bundle size with purging
- Great responsive design utilities
- Strong community and documentation

**Alternatives considered:**
- CSS Modules (more verbose)
- Styled Components (runtime overhead)
- Plain CSS (harder to maintain consistency)
- Material-UI (too opinionated for custom design)

### PostCSS 8.4.0
**Why chosen:**
- Required by Tailwind CSS
- Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility
- Plugin ecosystem for CSS optimization

## State Management

### Zustand 4.0.0
**Why chosen:**
- Lightweight (2.8kb gzipped vs 41kb for Redux + toolkit)
- Simple API, less boilerplate than Redux
- TypeScript-first design
- No providers needed
- Great for small to medium applications

**Alternatives considered:**
- Redux Toolkit (too heavyweight for this app size)
- Context API (performance issues for frequent updates)
- Recoil (Facebook-specific, less ecosystem)
- Jotai (atomic approach, but more complex for our use case)

## Testing

### Jest 29.0.0
**Why chosen:**
- Industry standard for React testing
- Excellent mocking capabilities
- Built-in code coverage
- Snapshot testing for components
- Great TypeScript support

### React Testing Library
**Why chosen:**
- Promotes testing best practices (user-focused)
- Better than Enzyme for modern React
- Encourages accessible component design
- Works well with Jest

**Alternatives considered:**
- Enzyme (outdated, doesn't support hooks well)
- Cypress (for E2E, but overkill for unit tests)

## Code Quality

### ESLint 8.0.0 + TypeScript ESLint
**Why chosen:**
- Catches potential bugs and bad patterns
- Enforces consistent code style
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Customizable rules
- IDE integration

### Prettier (Planned)
**Why needed:**
- Consistent code formatting
- Reduces code review discussions about style
- Auto-formatting on save
- Works well with ESLint

## Camera & Media APIs

### Native Web APIs
**Why chosen:**
- `getUserMedia()` for camera access
- `MediaDevices API` for device enumeration
- No external dependencies needed
- Better performance than libraries
- Full control over implementation

**Alternatives considered:**
- react-webcam (adds abstraction layer we don't need)
- MediaPipe (overkill for basic camera functionality)

## Quality Assessment

### Custom Implementation
**Why chosen:**
- Canvas API for image analysis
- Full control over quality metrics
- No external dependencies
- Lightweight implementation

**Alternatives considered:**
- OpenCV.js (too heavyweight, 8MB+ bundle)
- TensorFlow.js (overkill for basic image quality)

## Development Tools

### TypeScript Compiler
**Configuration highlights:**
- Strict mode enabled for better type safety
- ES6+ target for modern JavaScript features
- JSX support for React components

### HTTPS Development Server
**Why included:**
- Camera APIs require secure context
- localhost SSL certificates provided
- Mirrors production environment

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Splitting
- React.lazy() for code splitting
- Tree shaking with ES modules
- Minimal external dependencies

### Image Optimization
- Canvas API for client-side processing
- Efficient blob handling for captured images
- Memory management for video streams

## Browser Support

### Target Browsers
- Chrome 90+ (primary development target)
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Progressive Enhancement
- Feature detection for camera APIs
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Touch device optimizations

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additions
- **PWA Support**: Service workers, manifest.json
- **Build Optimization**: Vite migration for faster dev server
- **Advanced Camera**: Multiple camera support, manual controls
- **Image Processing**: WASM modules for heavy processing
- **Analytics**: Privacy-focused usage tracking

### Scaling Considerations
- **State Management**: Migrate to Redux if state complexity grows
- **Component Library**: Extract reusable components
- **Micro-frontends**: If expanding to multiple apps
- **Backend Integration**: API client libraries when backend is added
