# 6. Detailed Epic Breakdown - Web Prototype Focus

## Epic 1: Basic Web Camera Scanning (Phase 0 - CURRENT FOCUS)

**Epic Description:** Create web-based camera interface that works on desktop and mobile browsers for initial business card scanning validation.

**User Stories:**
- **US1.1:** As a user, I want to access the camera through my web browser so I can scan business cards on my laptop
- **US1.2:** As a user, I want to access the scanning interface on my mobile browser via IP address so I can test mobile scanning
- **US1.3:** As a user, I want to capture a clear image of a business card so the OCR can process it accurately
- **US1.4:** As a user, I want visual feedback when capturing so I know the image quality is sufficient

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Camera interface loads in Chrome/Safari on desktop
- Mobile web access works via local IP address
- Image capture produces clear, readable business card photos
- Basic image preview and retake functionality
- No crashes or performance issues during capture

**Technical Requirements:**
- WebRTC camera API integration
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers  
- Image quality validation before processing
- Basic error handling for camera access permissions

## Epic 2: OCR Processing & Data Extraction (Phase 0 - CURRENT FOCUS)

**Epic Description:** Implement Tesseract.js OCR to extract text from business card images and parse into structured contact fields.

**User Stories:**
- **US2.1:** As a user, I want the system to automatically extract text from my scanned business card so I don't have to type anything
- **US2.2:** As a user, I want the extracted information organized into proper fields (name, company, phone, email) so it's usable
- **US2.3:** As a user, I want to see the extraction results immediately so I can verify accuracy
- **US2.4:** As a user, I want to manually correct any OCR errors so the final contact is accurate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tesseract.js successfully extracts text from business card images
- Text is parsed into name, company, phone, email, title fields
- Extraction accuracy of 70%+ on standard business card formats
- Results display in organized, readable format
- Manual editing interface for corrections
- Processing time under 10 seconds per card

**Technical Requirements:**
- Tesseract.js integration and configuration
- Text parsing algorithms for field identification
- RegEx patterns for phone/email recognition
- Error handling for failed OCR attempts
