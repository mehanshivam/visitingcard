# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Project Goals
- Build a mobile app that transforms physical business card exchanges into active, ongoing professional relationships
- Implement zero-typing philosophy with automated scanning and intelligent relationship nurturing
- Achieve 1,000 active users within 6 months of MVP launch
- Reach 90% OCR accuracy rate and 70% monthly engagement
- Reduce contact entry time from 3+ minutes to under 30 seconds per card

## Background Context
Physical business card exchanges create critical relationship gaps where valuable professional connections are lost due to manual friction. Current scanning apps focus on data digitization rather than relationship activation, requiring manual review and providing basic storage without enrichment. This creates adoption barriers and fails to bridge the gap between scanning and meaningful business engagement.

## Market Opportunity
Building on proven demand (validated by CamCard's success), targeting marketing and networking professionals with relationship activation tools rather than just contact databases.

## Change Log
- v1.0: Initial comprehensive PRD based on detailed project brief
