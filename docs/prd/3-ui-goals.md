# 3. UI Goals

## Primary UI Goals

**Zero-Typing Experience:**
- UIG001: Single-tap scanning workflow - camera opens, auto-captures, processes automatically
- UIG002: Minimal user input required - system handles field mapping and data completion
- UIG003: Smart defaults and auto-corrections to eliminate manual typing
- UIG004: Progressive disclosure - show enriched data as it loads, don't block user

**Professional & Time-Efficient Design:**
- UIG005: Clean, professional interface suitable for business networking context
- UIG006: Quick access patterns - frequently used actions within 1-2 taps
- UIG007: Visual feedback for processing states (scanning, enriching, saving)
- UIG008: Streamlined contact review - highlight key business intelligence prominently

**Mobile-First Optimization:**
- UIG009: Optimized for one-handed use during networking events
- UIG010: Large touch targets for easy interaction in crowded/dark venues
- UIG011: High contrast design for various lighting conditions
- UIG012: Offline-first interface - core functions work without connectivity

**Contact Management Excellence:**
- UIG013: Visual contact cards showing enriched profiles (photo, company, context)
- UIG014: Smart search with business intelligence filtering
- UIG015: Quick actions for common follow-up tasks (call, email, LinkedIn)
- UIG016: Export/sync options clearly accessible but not intrusive
