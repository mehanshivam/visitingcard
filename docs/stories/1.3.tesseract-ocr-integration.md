# Story 1.3: Tesseract OCR Integration

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** business card text extraction using OCR technology,
**so that** I can automatically capture contact information from scanned business cards

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tesseract.js library integrated and configured for business card OCR
2. OCR processing replaces mock data in scanning workflow 
3. Text extraction accuracy of 70% or higher for standard business cards
4. Basic field parsing for name, phone, email, and company information
5. Error handling for OCR failures and low-quality images
6. Processing time feedback during OCR operations
7. Fallback mechanisms when OCR confidence is too low

- [x] Task 4: Implement field parsing and extraction (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create contact field detection algorithms
  - [x] Implement regex patterns for phone, email extraction
  - [x] Add name and company identification logic
  - [x] Handle multiple contact formats and layouts
- [x] Task 5: Error handling and fallback mechanisms (AC: 5, 7)
  - [x] Implement OCR confidence thresholds
  - [x] Add retry mechanisms for low-quality results
  - [x] Create fallback UI for manual data entry
  - [x] Handle processing timeouts and errors
- [x] Task 6: Testing and validation (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create test suite with real business card images
  - [x] Validate 70% accuracy requirement with diverse card formats
  - [x] Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - [x] Performance testing for OCR processing times

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Integration
Integration with Story 1.2 (Basic Scanning Workflow):
- Replace mock processing in ProcessingStep component
- Maintain existing workflow state management
- Use established image capture from scanning workflow
- Preserve mobile compatibility and responsive design

### Epic 1 Completion Goal
This story completes Epic 1 "Basic Web Camera Scanning" requirements:
- âœ… Web-based camera interface (Stories 1.1, 1.2)
- âœ… Simple scan â†’ display workflow (Stories 1.1, 1.2)
- ðŸ”„ Tesseract.js OCR integration (This story)
- ðŸŽ¯ Validate core scanning concept (Upon completion)

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#31-frontend-architecture]
- Extend existing React/TypeScript component structure
- Integrate with Zustand workflow store
- OCR service location: `src/services/ocrService.ts`
- Update processing logic in `src/hooks/useScanWorkflow.ts`

### OCR Performance Requirements
[Source: prd/2-requirements.md]
- Target 70% accuracy for standard business cards
- Processing time under 10 seconds for typical images
- Handle image preprocessing for OCR optimization
- Support common business card formats and layouts

### Data Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/4-data-architecture.md#42-data-flow-architecture]
- OCR results feed into contact data structure
- Prepare foundation for Epic 2 data enhancement
- Consider local caching for OCR results
- Design for offline OCR processing capability

### Testing Strategy
[Based on acceptance criteria and Epic 1 validation goal]
- Test file locations: `src/services/__tests__/ocrService.test.ts`
- Integration testing: Update existing workflow tests
- Real image testing: Create test suite with business card samples
- Performance testing: Measure OCR processing times
- Accuracy validation: Automated tests for 70% accuracy requirement
- Error scenario testing: Low quality images, unsupported formats
- Mobile testing: OCR performance on mobile devices
