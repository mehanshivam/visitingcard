  - [x] Add field-specific error handling and suggestions
- [x] Task 7: Fuzzy matching and error correction (AC: 7)
  - [x] Implement fuzzy string matching for OCR text errors
  - [x] Add common OCR error corrections (0/O, 1/l, etc.)
  - [x] Handle partial text extraction and reconstruction
  - [x] Add spell checking for names and company words

## Dev Notes

### Current Parser Analysis
Based on Epic 1 testing, current parsing issues include:
- Inconsistent name detection (sometimes picks company name as person name)
- Phone number formats not standardized
- Email detection works but could be more robust
- Company identification confused by job titles
- No confidence scoring to indicate parsing reliability

### Technical Architecture
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#31-frontend-architecture]
- Enhance existing `src/services/ocrService.ts` parseContactData method
- Add new field-specific parsing modules
- Implement validation and confidence scoring utilities
- Maintain backward compatibility with current data structures

### Enhanced Parsing Strategy
1. **Multi-pass parsing**: First pass for obvious patterns, second pass for context analysis
2. **Position analysis**: Use text positioning and line order for field identification
3. **Pattern libraries**: Build comprehensive regex and keyword libraries
4. **Validation pipeline**: Implement field validation with confidence scoring
5. **Error correction**: Add fuzzy matching and common OCR error fixes

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive test suite with real business card samples
- A/B testing against current parser for accuracy comparison
- Performance benchmarking to ensure parsing speed
- Edge case testing with unusual business card formats
- Accuracy metrics tracking per field type

### Data Flow Enhancement
[Source: architecture/4-data-architecture.md#42-data-flow-architecture]
- Enhanced ContactData interface with confidence scores
- Field validation results and suggestions
- Parsing metadata for debugging and improvement
- Support for multiple parsing candidates per field
