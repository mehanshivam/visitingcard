# Story 1.2: Basic Scanning Workflow

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a complete scan → process → display workflow,
**so that** I can validate the core scanning concept end-to-end

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete workflow from camera capture to results display
2. Clear navigation between scan steps (capture → process → results)
3. Basic loading states during processing
4. Results display shows captured image and placeholder for extracted data
5. Ability to restart the scanning process
6. Workflow works consistently on desktop and mobile browsers

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create scanning workflow state management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Design scanning workflow states (idle, capturing, processing, results, error)
  - [x] Implement workflow state transitions and navigation
  - [x] Create workflow context/store for state management
  - [x] Add workflow navigation controls (next, back, restart)
- [x] Task 2: Build scanning workflow UI components (AC: 2, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create ScanningWorkflow container component
  - [x] Build step indicator/progress component
  - [x] Create ProcessingStep component with loading states
  - [x] Build ResultsStep component for image and data display
  - [x] Add restart/new scan functionality
- [x] Task 3: Integrate camera capture with workflow (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Connect Camera component to workflow state
  - [x] Handle image capture completion and workflow progression
  - [x] Implement processing transition with loading feedback
  - [x] Add error handling for workflow interruptions
- [x] Task 4: Create results display layout (AC: 4)
  - [x] Design results layout with captured image preview
  - [x] Add placeholder sections for extracted contact data
  - [x] Implement responsive design for results display
  - [x] Add basic styling and visual hierarchy
- [x] Task 5: Testing and mobile compatibility (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create comprehensive test suite for workflow components
  - [x] Test workflow state transitions and navigation
  - [x] Verify mobile browser compatibility and responsiveness
  - [x] Test complete workflow end-to-end

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Integration
Integration with Story 1.1 (Camera Access):
- Use existing Camera component within the workflow
- Leverage existing camera service and hooks
- Build upon established error handling patterns
- Maintain mobile compatibility established in Story 1.1

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#31-frontend-architecture]
- Use React 18 with TypeScript for workflow components
- Extend Zustand store for workflow state management
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with camera interface
- Component structure: `src/components/Scanning/` for workflow components
- Workflow state management: `src/stores/scanWorkflowStore.ts`
- Workflow hook: `src/hooks/useScanWorkflow.ts`

### Workflow Architecture
[Source: architecture/4-data-architecture.md#42-data-flow-architecture]
- Implement Primary Scan Workflow foundation
- Prepare data flow for future OCR integration
- Consider local storage for workflow state persistence
- Design for offline scenarios and error recovery

### UI/UX Goals Integration
[Source: prd/3-ui-goals.md]
- Simple, intuitive workflow progression
- Clear visual feedback for each step
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible navigation and controls

### Testing
[Testing requirements based on acceptance criteria]
- Test file locations: `src/components/Scanning/__tests__/` for workflow components
- Workflow state testing: Mock state transitions and navigation
- Integration testing: Complete workflow from camera to results
- Mobile testing: Verify workflow on mobile browsers via local IP
- Performance testing: Monitor workflow state changes and rendering
- Error scenario testing: Test workflow interruptions and recovery
- Accessibility testing: Ensure workflow navigation is accessible
