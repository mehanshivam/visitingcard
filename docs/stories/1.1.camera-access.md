# Story 1.1: Camera Access

## Status
Approved

## Story

- [x] Task 3: Ensure mobile web compatibility (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Test camera access on mobile browsers
  - [x] Implement responsive design for camera interface
  - [x] Add mobile-specific touch interactions
  - [x] Ensure performance on mobile devices
- [x] Task 4: Image quality validation (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement basic image quality checks
  - [x] Add visual feedback for image clarity
  - [x] Set appropriate image resolution/format

  - [x] Implement graceful error handling and user feedback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#31-frontend-architecture]
- Use React 18 with TypeScript for component development
- Project uses Zustand for lightweight state management
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Component structure should follow: `src/components/Camera/` for camera-specific components
- Service should be placed in: `src/services/cameraService.ts`
- Custom hook should be created at: `src/hooks/useCamera.ts`
- State management for scanning workflow: `src/stores/scanStore.ts`

### Key Frontend Technologies
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#key-frontend-technologies]
- React 18: Use Concurrent features for better UX
- TypeScript: Ensure type safety for camera APIs
- Zustand: Manage camera state and scanning workflow
- Tailwind CSS: Style camera interface responsively
- Workbox: Consider offline functionality for PWA

### WebRTC Implementation Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 Technical Requirements]
- WebRTC camera API integration required
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers
- Image quality validation before processing
- Basic error handling for camera access permissions

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/4-data-architecture.md#42-data-flow-architecture]
- Camera capture is the first step in the Primary Scan Workflow
- Captured images will be processed by local OCR (Tesseract) before upload
- Consider local storage for offline scenarios

### API Integration Points
[Source: architecture/5-api-architecture.md#core-endpoints]
- Future integration with `POST /api/v1/scan/upload` endpoint for image processing
- Images should be prepared for upload to OCR service

### Testing
[Testing requirements based on acceptance criteria]
- Test file locations: Follow React testing patterns with `.test.tsx` files alongside components
- Testing frameworks: Standard React Testing Library for component testing
- Camera-specific testing: Mock WebRTC APIs for unit tests
- Cross-browser testing: Ensure functionality in Chrome/Safari on desktop
- Mobile testing: Test camera access via local IP address
- Performance testing: Monitor for crashes or performance issues during capture
- Error scenario testing: Test camera permission denied, no camera available
- Image quality validation testing: Verify capture produces readable business card photos
